The data that I'm "uploading" is slightly tied into the problem I am encountering. 

Below is a link to a graph of  US Recorded Music Revenues by Format over 40 years. It is produced by the RIAA, and this is essentially what I need for my project.  However, it's already visualized and to get the raw data, I would either have to contact them or create an excel sheet/csv from the graph. This also indicates that my project is of nothing new and not unique. I have not been able to make progress regarding my problem. I think I will have to think through my project to see if there is a different angle I can take, while I want to see if I am able to obtain raw data from RIAA or see if there is any publicly available data within the music indistury.

The excel sheet I have uploaded compiles the pays per stream for different music streaming services. The issue with this data is 1) I'm not sure if the source I got from is reputable . 2) Some months are missing big streaming services, and they are not consistent.
