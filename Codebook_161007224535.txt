Name:       STU_ID
Position:   1
Length:     6
Label:      Student ID

Description:
Student ID is composed of the 4-digit School ID (which consists of
the 3-digit stratum and 1-digit PSU) and a 2-digit sequential
student code within school.
Stratum (STRAT_ID) and PSU are embedded in STU_ID for ease of use
in certain variance estimation programs.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard-copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated-version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Name:       STRAT_ID
Position:   11
Length:     3
Label:      Stratum

Description:
This variable is a component of the ELS:2002 school ID (first three
digits). It indicates the analysis stratum to be used for computing
Taylor Series variance estimates. The analysis strata were formed
from the sampling strata used in the first stage of sampling. STRAT_ID
is developed at the school level and replicated at the student level.
This school level STRAT_ID should be used when generating school
estimates. In order to support improved variance estimation, a
larger number of strata (with fewer PSUs per stratum -- up to 3 PSUs
per stratum) are used in ELS:2002, compared to NELS:88 or HS&B. See
section 3.5 of the ELS:2002 Base Year Data File User's Manual.

Position:   14
Length:     2
Label:      Primary sampling unit

Description:
This variable is a component of the ELS:2002 school ID (fourth
digit). It indicates the analysis primary sampling unit (PSU, i.e.,
School) to be used for computing Taylor Series variance estimates.
PSU is developed at the school level and replicated at the student
level. This school level PSU should be used when generating school
estimates. In order to support improved variance estimation, a
larger number of strata (with fewer PSUs per stratum -- up to 3 PSUs
per stratum) are used in ELS:2002, compared to NELS:88 or HS&B.

Length:     4
Label:      Link to first follow-up school

Description:
F1SCH_ID is an ID corresponding to the school in which the student
is enrolled at the time of the first follow-up. F1SCH_ID values
pertain to in-school students still attending their base-year
school. F1SCH_ID values match SCH_ID values for base-year
schools. New schools were assigned values from 9995
to 9999. (See section 3.3 of the ELS:2002 Base-Year to First
Follow-up Data File User's Manual for definition of "new schools.")
F1SCH_ID is set to -8 for a student not attending a base-year or new
school in the first follow-up.

Length:     3
Label:      Sample member status in BY and F1 rounds

Description:
Indicates simultaneously the base year and first follow-up
status of sample members. This variable has valid values that
account for every pattern encountered by ELS:2002 sample members.
Value labels indicate BY status followed by F1 status.
Definition of BY component within value label
   BYR=Base Year Respondent
   BYN=Base Year Nonrespondent
   BYI=Base Year Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded Sample only)
   BNA=Base Year Not Applicable (i.e., Freshened 12th-grader in the
       first follow-up)
Definition of F1 component within value label
   F1R=First Follow-up Respondent with the following trailing
       characters meaning:
       A=In-school, in grade
       B=In-School out-of-grade
       D=Dropout
       F=Freshened
       E=Received HS diploma early (on or before 3/15/2004)
       G=Received GED/HS equivalent early (on or before 3/15/2004)
       H=Homeschooled
   F1NR=First Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F1IE=First Follow-up Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded
        Sample only)
   F1OD=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F1OS=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
For example, cases where F1UNIV1 = 101 relate to sample members with
the following participation patterns:  "BYR F1RA" In other words,
the sample members were BY respondents and F1 respondents
in-School/in grade.

Description:
Indicates simultaneously the base year, first follow-up, and second
follow-up status of each sample member. This variable has values that
account for all possible status patterns of ELS:2002 sample members.
Value labels indicate BY status, F1 status, and F2 status,
respectively.
Definition of BY component within value label:
   BYR=Base Year Respondent
   BYN=Base Year Nonrespondent
   BYI=Base Year Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded Sample only)
   BNA=Base Year Not Applicable (i.e., Freshened 12th-grader in the
       first follow-up)
Definition of F1 component within value label:
   F1R=First Follow-up Respondent
   F1NR=First Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F1IE=First Follow-up Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded
        Sample only)
   F1OD=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F1OS=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
Definition of F2 component within value label:
   F2R=Second Follow-up Respondent
   F2NR=Second Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F2OD= Second Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F2OS= Second Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
For example, cases where F2UNIV1=101 (BYR F1R F2R) relate to sample
members who were respondents in the base year, first follow-up, and
second follow-up surveys.

Label:      Spring 2004 senior cohort member

Description:
This variable indicates whether the sample member is a Senior cohort
member, i.e., a spring 2004 12th-grader. F1-identified senior
cohort members include F1 respondents at base year schools, as well as
those who transferred, if they indicated they were 12th-graders.
Spring 2004 grade was imputed where missing for F1 respondents (see
also F1GRADE/F2F1GRDE). G12COHRT has also been updated since the
first follow-up version to identify F1 nonrespondents whose second
follow-up or transcript information indicates they were in fact spring
2004 12th-graders. Values of 2 also include freshened cases who
were F1 questionnaire-ineligible.
Use G12COHRT in concert with F1, transcript, or F2 weights to get an
appropriately weighted sample that generalizes to the 2004 spring term
senior class. For example, G12COHRT=1 used with F1QWT generates
estimates for a nationally representative, cross-sectional population
of the 2004 spring term senior class. G12CHORT>0 used with F2F1WT
generates estimates for a nationally representative panel of the
spring term senior class, including F1 nonrespondents.
SAS Code:
If G12COHRT = 0 And F1NRSTAT > 0 Then Do;
   If F2F1GRDE=12 Then G12COHRT=2;
End;

Description:
Student final weight for all base year responding students. See
section 3.4.2 of the ELS:2002 Base Year Data File User's Manual.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Description:
Student final weight for the expanded sample of questionnaire-eligible
and questionnaire-ineligible students. Questionnaire-ineligible
students were excused from completion of the questionnaire or the
test when (for reasons of their lack of proficiency in English or
severe disabilities) they could not validly be assessed or complete a
questionnaire, or could only be surveyed under conditions that would
be unduly arduous or uncomfortable for them. This weight can be used
for analyses including the base year expanded sample.

-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.
Applies to: All respondents.
